# 2DLevelEditor

A Unity project created for my first Assignment in Computer Games Studio 2 at The University of Huddersfield. Year 1.

---------------------------------------------

Level editor features:

- Change grid size.
- Enable/Disable level walls (Collision).
- Select different tiles from the UI.
- Place and delete tiles from the level.
- Save, Load and Delete levels.
- Simple player character.
- Simple enemy objects.
- Placeholder main menu.

What I Learnt:

- How to create a modular editor.
- How to handle functionality between tools in the editor.
- Saving files for reconstructing current levels.
- Loading those files and reconstructing levels.
- User interface techniques.

---------------------------------------------

Known bugs:

- The player characters jump method makes it so that while jumping, if the characters head is blocked by the roof the jump method in the player script will continue run causing the player to hover. This can easily be fixed by changing the jump method or checking for collision.

---------------------------------------------

Refferences:

Textures for sprites:

- All of the level sprites came from the following link: https://opengameart.org/content/platformer-art-complete-pack-often-updated
- The UI sprites cam from the following link: https://www.gameart2d.com/free-fantasy-game-gui.html

---------------------------------------------

The code has been commented as it was required on submission for this assignment.

This project was made on Unity 5.6.1f.
